-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~\SISv5\Components\VotingSoftware

	
	a) CreateVotingSoftware.java ~ this file is where the main component lives, used CreateTemp.java as a template
	
	b) Util.java ~ where all the helper functions live
	
	
~\SISv5\ControllerComponents\VotingSoftware

	[Deprecated]a) BloodPressureAlert.java ~ It was throwing errors when I took this out. Realized there's a lot of dependies
	   so we can take those out later. Sorry its a little hacky.
	   
	[Deprecated]b) helper.java ~ instructions said to put this in here
	
	[Deprecated]c) initial.java ~ not sure
	
	d) pnml.xml ~ xml file that conrols component. 
	
	[Deprecated]e) TempAlert.java ~ same issues w/ dependencies so I kept it in for now
	
	
	* These were all from section 4.5 from the README_V5.txt file 


~\SISv5\Scripts\runIndividualComp

	a) when the SIS compiles it adds runVotingSoftware.bat. This happens because of section 4.5 in the directions.
	
	
~\SISv5\xml\DataXML\References

	a) AcknowledgeMSG.xml
	
	b) AckRequestReport.xml

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So this is ready to run as is if you download the entire SISv5 file from here. The directions to run the batch files
are from the following sections from the SISv5 readme: 
	
	
4.1. Initialize:
		a). Go to SISv5/Scripts/: 
		
			i) Double click the 'runserver.bat' file to start the SIS server. 
			
			ii) Double click the 'runInitializer.bat' file to batch register all existing 
			components (read all XML files under SISv5/xml/InitXML, including Controller components).
			
		b). GO to SISv5/Scripts/runIndividualComp/:
		
			i) Double click the 'runGUI.bat' file to start GUI. You will see a graphical window, 
			which will display active components' information later.
